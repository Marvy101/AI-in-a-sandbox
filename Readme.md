# AI in a Sandbox 

## Overview
This codebase is designed to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate and execute code using function calling. It uses an external API provided by OneCompiler to run Python code.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- `requests` library
- `openai` library

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries 
3. Obtain API keys for OpenAI and OneCompiler and set them in `love.py`:

## Usage
To use the codebase, simply run `main.py`

This will start a conversation with the AI, generate a complex question, solve it, and provide the output.

## Note
Do not upload `love.py` with your API keys to any public repositories for security reasons.

Enjoy!
